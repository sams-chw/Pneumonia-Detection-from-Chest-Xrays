# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-Xrays

Pneumonia is an infection that affects one or both lungs. It causes the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. Bacteria, viruses, or fungi may cause pneumonia. Chest X-ray helps doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the location and extent of inflammation in the lungs. However, it can't tell what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.

The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning based model that will assist radiologists in detecting the presence of Pneumonia in Chest X-Rays.
